"""Wire-redaction tests: capture EVERY payload each socket ever receives and
assert the hidden-information matrix over all of them — no deck arrays, hands
only to their owner, discard as top+count, the pending frame's constraint only
to the actor (and its data to nobody), reconnect_tokens only the viewer's own,
rng_state/seed absent, and the game-over reveal."""
