"""Retired Spender AI variants that must still SERVE.

The lobby offers four personas — H2 (Henry), H3 (Herald), S (Steve), N (Nina).
Everything else is retired: no UI can create a game with it. But retired is not
dead, and this module exists because of exactly that distinction:

    `ai_variant` is PERSISTED with the game and restored on load.

A game created months ago against variant Z or H is still resumable, and dropping
its chooser would downgrade or break that game on the next AI turn. So these
cannot be deleted, and they cannot move to `ai/offline/` either — that package is
never imported by the server, which is the whole point of it. They belong here:
in the serving stack, but out of `main.py`, which was carrying the deployed rules,
every DB query, the room server, AND the retired brains in one 3,400-line module.

WHAT'S HERE
  Z  — the AlphaZero net (PUCT + numpy inference, no torch in prod). Enabled only
       when ai/models/az_model.npz is present; absent, `evaluate()` stays None and
       `_ai_variant_valid` rejects "Z", so a fresh game can never select it.
  H  — the v4 valuation heuristic: 1-ply greedy argmax over the shared card model,
       no search. Plus its card-value transparency overlay.

Weight variants A/B/C/C2 are also retired but are pure DATA (weights*.json) fed to
the still-live `_mcts_choose_move`, so there is no code to move for them.

Behaviour here is byte-identical to what main.py ran before the move.
